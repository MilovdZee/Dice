# Dice
Multiple dice problem solvers

My daughter of 10 came to me and asked the following: I have 23 dice and throw them all. I remove all dice with 6 and throw the rest again. I do this untill all dice show 6. How many times do I need to roll the dice before they are all 6?
Seems simple enough to calculate... Well I couldn't... What was my university good for :) So I wrote a program to simulate throwing the dice. I started with 100,000 rounds and the result was around 21 rounds. Then I found a pdf with the answer and my estimate was correct but only accurate to two decimals... Even with 1,000,000 rounds the accuracy was not very good. Statistics keep to amaze me.
